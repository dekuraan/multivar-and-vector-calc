Equations of lines and planes
## Vector equation of the line
line = position vector + direction vector
## Parametric equation of line
- $x = x_0 + ta$
- $y = y_0 + tb$
- $z = z_0 + tc$
skew line = non-parallel non-intersecting line (only in 3d+ space)
[Cramer's Rule](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/cramers.htm)
## symmetric form of a line
- $t = \frac{x-x_0}{a}$
- $t = \frac{y-y_0}{b}$
- $t = \frac{z-z_0}{c}$
or
$$\frac{x-x_0}{a}=\frac{y-y_0}{b}=\frac{z-z_0}{b}=t$$
## Equation of a plane 
must specify one point on the plane and one perpendicular line to the plane
$$ax+by+cz=d$$
$ai+bj+ck$ = the parallel vector
## equation of line of intersection of two planes
solve both equations 
or
cross product the perpendicular vectors of the planes
and find a single point
to find a single point just set one of the components = 0 (ex. z=0)
then solve
